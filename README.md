# Project One - Interpret Data Visualizations.

A large part of working with data is being able to interpret data visualizations and explain our insights to others.

In this project we used Tableau dashboards to set three insights. I chose to work with the LinkedIn Dashboard so I had to do two things:

* Find three insights in the visualizations.
* Write a short report explaining each observation and how you found the information to reach your conclusion from the dashboard. Altogether and included some images and finally present it in PDF file.

# Project Two - Analyze NYSE Data.

In this project, I conducted my own data analysis through a real life data from the New York Stock Exchange. I had to create a subset of a large dataset provided by Kaggle that contains historical financial data from S&P 500 companies. 

*  I've created an Excel workbook that contained my calculations of the summary statistics, dashboard and forecast scenarios.
*  I've created a PDF file that shared my findings through my analysis in the Excel workbook.

# Project Three - SQL Project.

In this project, I've created queries for Chinook Database. The Chinook Database holds information about a music store. The main purpose of this project is to assist the Chinook team with understanding the media in their store, their customers and employees, and their invoice information by using SQL queries to find the information that they need from the database. So I had to do few things to help them with this by:
* transforming the needed information to questions and try to answer it by SQL through database.
* write a query for each question and make a visualization for it.
* create a PDF file to present the questions with its answers and visualizations to clarify the information that the team was looking for.

# Project Four - Create A Dashboards.

In this project, I've createed my own visualization through Tableau to reveal insights from a data set. I used YouTube US dataset that was imported from Kaggle dataset. it included a bunch of information for videos that were trending for at least one day. I had to work on some criteria of data visualization that my project had to have it like; visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication. So;

* I’ve created a story for the top popular channels & media in the US based on states.
The story displayed the most liked categories, top popular channels, top popular channel’s title, and the top popular music; based on people’s reactions.
