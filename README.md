# Project one - interpret data visualizations.

A large part of working with data is being able to interpret data visualizations and explain our insights to others.

In this project we used Tableau dashboards to set three insights. I chose to work with the LinkedIn Dashboard so I had to do two things:

* Find three insights in the visualizations.
* Write a short report explaining each observation and how you found the information to reach your conclusion from the dashboard. Altogether and included some images and finally present it in PDF file.
